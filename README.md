## 📝 Getting Started

1. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`.
2. Verify the `.env` file (or `.env.example`) provides a `DATABASE_URL` that points at your PostgreSQL instance and any other secrets you expect to override.
3. Run `pnpm prisma generate` so that `@prisma/client` can load the generated runtime (`.prisma/client/default` is missing until you do this).
4. (Optional) Seed the database with `pnpm run db:seed`.
5. Start the dev server via `pnpm run dev`.

> ⚠️ Whenever you reinstall dependencies or change the Prisma schema, rerun `pnpm prisma generate` before starting Astro. Skipping this step triggers the “Cannot find module '.prisma/client/default'” error when the API tries to instantiate `PrismaClient`.
